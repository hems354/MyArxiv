This gap exists because current alignment research has primarily\nachieved progress in specific areas (e.g., hallucination reduction), while the\nbroader question of whether aligning models with human preferences can\nsystematically enhance MLLM capability remains largely unexplored. To this end,\nwe introduce MM-RLHF, a dataset containing $\\mathbf{120k}$ fine-grained,\nhuman-annotated preference comparison pairs. This dataset represents a\nsubstantial advancement over existing resources, offering superior size,\ndiversity, annotation granularity, and quality. Leveraging this dataset, we\npropose several key innovations to improve both the quality of reward models\nand the efficiency of alignment algorithms. Notably, we introduce a\nCritique-Based Reward Model, which generates critiques of model outputs before\nassigning scores, offering enhanced interpretability and more informative\nfeedback compared to traditional scalar reward mechanisms. Additionally, we\npropose Dynamic Reward Scaling, a method that adjusts the loss weight of each\nsample according to the reward signal, thereby optimizing the use of\nhigh-quality comparison pairs. Our approach is rigorously evaluated across\n$\\mathbf{10}$ distinct dimensions and $\\mathbf{27}$ benchmarks, with results\ndemonstrating significant and consistent improvements in model performance.\nSpecifically, fine-tuning LLaVA-ov-7B with MM-RLHF and our alignment algorithm\nleads to a $\\mathbf{19.5}$% increase in conversational abilities and a\n$\\mathbf{60}$% improvement in safety.\n  We have open-sourced the preference dataset, reward model, training and\nevaluation code, as well as reward modeling and safety benchmarks.

However, the cost of fine-tuning an LLM is prohibitive\nfor many users. Due to their ability to bypass LLM fine-tuning, prediction-time\ntokenwise reward-guided text generation (RGTG) methods have recently been\nproposed. They use a reward model trained on full sequences to score partial\nsequences during decoding in a bid to steer the generation towards sequences\nwith high rewards.

In this work, we show that reward models trained\non full sequences are not compatible with scoring partial sequences.

This dependency makes these models less\neffective in dynamic few-shot text classification, where labeled data is\nscarce, and new target labels frequently appear based on application needs.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their\nextensive pretraining and contextual understanding ability. Current approaches\nprovide LLMs with text inputs, candidate labels, and additional side\ninformation (e.g., descriptions) to classify texts. However, their\neffectiveness is hindered by the increased input size and the noise introduced\nthrough side information processing. To address these limitations, we propose a\ngraph-based online retrieval-augmented generation framework, namely GORAG, for\ndynamic few-shot text classification. Rather than treating each input\nindependently, GORAG constructs and maintains a weighted graph by extracting\nside information across all target texts. In this graph, text keywords and\nlabels are represented as nodes, with edges indicating the correlations between\nthem. To model these correlations, GORAG employs an edge weighting mechanism to\nprioritize the importance and reliability of extracted information and\ndynamically retrieves relevant context using a minimum-cost spanning tree\ntailored for each text input.

We first show, theoretically, that the only representation comparison\noperation performed by LLMs, namely that between context and unembedding\nvectors to determine continuation probabilities, is not characterized by the\nconcentration of distances phenomenon that typically causes the appeareance of\nnuisance hubness. We then empirically show that this comparison still leads to\na high degree of hubness, but the hubs in this case do not constitute a\ndisturbance.

To address this\nchallenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained\ndecoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM\nplanners' capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures\nconsistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)\nformulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the\nmajority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then\nuses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of\nplans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. Domain-specific\nfine-tuning customizes LLMs to produce safe and efficient plans within specific\ntask domains.

Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged to shed light on these 'black\nbox' models, aiding in deciphering their decision-making processes. However,\ndifferent XAI methods often produce significantly different explanations,\nleading to high inter-method variability that increases uncertainty and\nundermines trust in deep networks' predictions. In this study, we address this\nchallenge by introducing a novel framework designed to enhance the\nexplainability of deep networks through a dual focus on maximizing both\naccuracy and comprehensibility in the explanations. Our framework integrates\noutputs from multiple established XAI methods and leverages a non-linear neural\nnetwork model, termed the 'explanation optimizer,' to construct a unified,\noptimal explanation. The optimizer evaluates explanations using two key\nmetrics: faithfulness (accuracy in reflecting the network's decisions) and\ncomplexity (comprehensibility). By balancing these, it provides accurate and\naccessible explanations, addressing a key XAI limitation. Experiments on\nmulti-class and binary classification in 2D object and 3D neuroscience imaging\nconfirm its efficacy.

Additionally, class imbalance, which is common in real-world datasets,\nfurther complicates FER. Although many studies have shown impressive\nimprovements, they typically address only one of these issues, leading to\nsuboptimal results. To tackle both challenges simultaneously, we propose a\nnovel framework called Navigating Label Ambiguity (NLA), which is robust under\nreal-world conditions. The motivation behind NLA is that dynamically estimating\nand emphasizing ambiguous samples at each iteration helps mitigate noise and\nclass imbalance by reducing the model's bias toward majority classes. To\nachieve this, NLA consists of two main components: Noise-aware Adaptive\nWeighting (NAW) and consistency regularization. Specifically, NAW adaptively\nassigns higher importance to ambiguous samples and lower importance to noisy\nones, based on the correlation between the intermediate prediction scores for\nthe ground truth and the nearest negative. Moreover, we incorporate a\nregularization term to ensure consistent latent distributions. Consequently,\nNLA enables the model to progressively focus on more challenging ambiguous\nsamples, which primarily belong to the minority class, in the later stages of\ntraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NLA outperforms existing\nmethods in both overall and mean accuracy, confirming its robustness against\nnoise and class imbalance.

From the perspective of mechanism\ninterpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a\nboundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations.\nTherefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are\ninevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability.

Our approach begins by constructing a\nuniversal image feature dictionary using a multi-stage approach involving\nmodified spatial pyramid pooling, dimension reduction, and multi-scale feature\nclustering. For each input image, we learn to synthesize a conditioning latent\nby selecting and synthesizing relevant features from the dictionary, which\nsignificantly enhances the model's capability in capturing and exploring image\nsource correlation. This conditional latent synthesis involves a\ncorrelation-based feature matching and alignment strategy, comprising a\nConditional Latent Matching (CLM) module and a Conditional Latent Synthesis\n(CLS) module.

Our OCL approach is simple: we randomly mask patches to\ngenerate different views within an image and contrast them among a mini-batch\nof images. The core idea behind OCL consists of two designs. First, masked\ntokens have the potential to significantly diminish the conceptual redundancy\ninherent in images, and create distinct views with substantial fine-grained\ndifferences on the semantic concept level instead of the instance level.\nSecond, contrastive learning is adept at extracting high-level semantic\nconceptual features during the pre-training, circumventing the high-frequency\ninterference and additional costs associated with image reconstruction.\nImportantly, OCL learns highly semantic conceptual representations efficiently\nwithout relying on hand-crafted data augmentations or additional auxiliary\nmodules. Empirically, OCL demonstrates high scalability with Vision\nTransformers, as the ViT-L/16 can complete pre-training in 133 hours using only\n4 A100 GPUs, achieving 85.8\\% accuracy in downstream fine-tuning tasks.

This limitation is especially problematic for\napplications like surveillance and mobile communications, where low image\nresolution is common and can compromise recognition accuracy. Traditional\nsingle-image face super-resolution (FSR) techniques, however, often fail to\npreserve the emotional intent of expressions, introducing distortions that\nobscure the original affective content. Given the inherently ill-posed nature\nof single-image super-resolution, a targeted approach is required to balance\nimage quality enhancement with emotion retention.

Decentralized alternatives fail to offer equal document\nretrieval accuracy and speed. Nevertheless, Semantic Overlay Networks can come\nclose to the performance of centralized solutions when the semantics of\ndocuments are properly captured. This work uses embeddings from Large Language\nModels to capture semantics and fulfill the promise of Semantic Overlay\nNetworks. Our proposed algorithm, called Semantica, constructs a prefix tree\n(trie) utilizing document embeddings calculated by a language model. Users\nconnect to each other based on the embeddings of their documents, ensuring that\nsemantically similar users are directly linked. Thereby, this construction\nmakes it more likely for user searches to be answered by the users that they\nare directly connected to, or by the users they are close to in the network\nconnection graph. The implementation of our algorithm also accommodates the\nsemantic diversity of individual users by spawning \"clone\" user identifiers in\nthe tree. Our experiments use emulation with a real-world workload to show\nSemantica's ability to identify and connect to similar users quickly. Semantica\nfinds up to ten times more semantically similar users than current\nstate-of-the-art approaches. At the same time, Semantica can retrieve more than\ntwo times the number of relevant documents given the same network load.

By applying two downsampling approaches to\nseven datasets, 12 algorithms, and two levels of core pruning, the research\ndemonstrates significant reductions in runtime and carbon emissions. For\nexample, a 30% downsampling portion can reduce runtime by 52% compared to the\nfull dataset, leading to a carbon emission reduction of up to 51.02 KgCO2e\nduring the training of a single algorithm on a single dataset. The analysis\nreveals that algorithm performance under different downsampling portions\ndepends on factors like dataset characteristics, algorithm complexity, and the\nspecific downsampling configuration (scenario dependent).

The limitation of proper learning, however, is that there\nexist problems which can only be learned improperly, e.g. in multiclass\nclassification. Thus, we ask: Under what assumptions on the hypothesis class or\nthe information provided to the learner is a problem properly learnable? We\nfirst demonstrate that when the unlabeled data distribution is given, there\nalways exists an optimal proper learner governed by distributional\nregularization, a randomized generalization of regularization. We refer to this\nsetting as the distribution-fixed PAC model, and continue to evaluate the\nlearner on its worst-case performance over all distributions. Our result holds\nfor all metric loss functions and any finite learning problem (with no\ndependence on its size). Further, we demonstrate that sample complexities in\nthe distribution-fixed PAC model can shrink by only a logarithmic factor from\nthe classic PAC model, strongly refuting the role of unlabeled data in PAC\nlearning (from a worst-case perspective).\n  We complement this with impossibility results which obstruct any\ncharacterization of proper learnability in the realizable PAC model. First, we\nobserve that there are problems whose proper learnability is logically\nundecidable, i.e., independent of the ZFC axioms. We then show that proper\nlearnability is not a monotone property of the underlying hypothesis class, and\nthat it is not a local property (in a precise sense).

This study presents the first systematic attempt to\nidentify prompts and text tokens in MIMIC-CXR that contribute the most to\ntraining data memorization. Our analysis reveals two unexpected findings: (1)\nprompts containing traces of de-identification procedures (markers introduced\nto hide Protected Health Information) are the most memorized, and (2) among all\ntokens, de-identification markers contribute the most towards memorization.\nThis highlights a broader issue with the standard anonymization practices and\nT2I synthesis with MIMIC-CXR. To exacerbate, existing inference-time\nmemorization mitigation strategies are ineffective and fail to sufficiently\nreduce the model's reliance on memorized text tokens.

We apply an explainable AI technique, SHAP, to assess\nthe importance of each fiber cluster for prediction. Our results demonstrate\nthat shape measures are predictive of individual cognitive performance. The\nstudied shape measures, such as irregularity, diameter, total surface area,\nvolume, and branch volume, are as effective for prediction as microstructure\nand connectivity measures. The overall best-performing feature is a shape\nfeature, irregularity, which describes how different a cluster's shape is from\nan idealized cylinder.

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel\nmethod named Causal Information Prioritization (CIP) that improves sample\nefficiency by leveraging factored MDPs to infer causal relationships between\ndifferent dimensions of states and actions with respect to rewards, enabling\nthe prioritization of causal information. Specifically, CIP identifies and\nleverages causal relationships between states and rewards to execute\ncounterfactual data augmentation to prioritize high-impact state features under\nthe causal understanding of the environments. Moreover, CIP integrates a\ncausality-aware empowerment learning objective, which significantly enhances\nthe agent's execution of reward-guided actions for more efficient exploration\nin complex environments. To fully assess the effectiveness of CIP, we conduct\nextensive experiments across 39 tasks in 5 diverse continuous control\nenvironments, encompassing both locomotion and manipulation skills learning\nwith pixel-based and sparse reward settings.

The core\ncomponent of CrossFi is a sample-similarity calculation network called CSi-Net,\nwhich improves the structure of the siamese network by using an attention\nmechanism to capture similarity information, instead of simply calculating the\ndistance or cosine similarity.

The\nmajor advantages of VML include (1) easy encoding of inductive bias: prior\nknowledge about the problem and hypothesis class can be encoded in natural\nlanguage and fed into the LLM-parameterized learner; (2) automatic model class\nselection: the optimizer can automatically select a model class based on data\nand verbalized prior knowledge, and it can update the model class during\ntraining; and (3) interpretable learner updates: the LLM-parameterized\noptimizer can provide explanations for why an update is performed.

In this\npaper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison, revealing that some existing\ndefense methods can improve the robustness of LLMs against multi-turn\njailbreaks but compromise usability, i.e., reducing general capabilities or\ncausing the over-refusal problem. From the perspective of mechanism\ninterpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a\nboundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations.\nTherefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are\ninevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability. To address this issue,\nwe propose X-Boundary to push harmful representations away from boundary-safe\nrepresentations and obtain an exact distinction boundary. In this way, harmful\nrepresentations can be precisely erased without disrupting safe ones.\nExperimental results show that X-Boundary achieves state-of-the-art defense\nperformance against multi-turn jailbreaks, while reducing the over-refusal rate\nby about 20% and maintaining nearly complete general capability.

Prior works on self-debugging mostly\nfocus on prompting methods by providing LLMs with few-shot examples, which work\npoorly on small open-sourced LLMs. In this work, we propose LeDex, a training\nframework that significantly improves the self-debugging capability of LLMs.\nIntuitively, we observe that a chain of explanations on the wrong code followed\nby code refinement helps LLMs better analyze the wrong code and do refinement.\nWe thus propose an automated pipeline to collect a high-quality dataset for\ncode explanation and refinement by generating a number of explanations and\nrefinement trajectories from the LLM itself or a larger teacher model and\nfiltering via execution verification. We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure\ntrajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and\nrefinement quality. SFT improves the pass@1 by up to 15.92% and pass@10 by\n9.30% over four benchmarks. RL training brings additional up to 3.54%\nimprovement on pass@1 and 2.55% improvement on pass@10. The trained LLMs show\niterative refinement ability and can keep refining code continuously. Lastly,\nour human evaluation shows that the LLMs trained with our framework generate\nmore useful code explanations and help developers better understand bugs in\nsource code.\n","authors":["Nan Jiang","Xiaopeng Li","Shiqi Wang","Qiang Zhou","Soneya Binta Hossain","Baishakhi Ray","Varun Kumar","Xiaofei Ma","Anoop Deoras"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18649v2.pdf","comment":"This paper is accepted by The Thirty-eighth Annual Conference on\n  Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09815v1","updated":"2025-02-13T23:24:25Z","published":"2025-02-13T23:24:25Z","title":"Statistical Coherence Alignment for Large Language Model Representation\n  Learning Through Tensor Field Convergence","summary":"  Representation learning plays a central role in structuring internal\nembeddings to capture the statistical properties of language, influencing the\ncoherence and contextual consistency of generated text. Statistical Coherence\nAlignment is introduced as a method to enforce structured token representations\nthrough tensor field convergence, guiding embeddings to reflect statistical\ndependencies inherent in linguistic data. A mathematical framework is\nestablished to quantify coherence alignment, integrating a loss function that\noptimizes representational consistency across training iterations. Empirical\nevaluations demonstrate that applying coherence constraints improves\nperplexity, enhances classification accuracy, and refines rare word embeddings,\ncontributing to a more stable representation space. Comparative analyses with\nbaseline models reveal that the proposed method fosters a more interpretable\ninternal structure, ensuring that embeddings retain contextual dependencies\nwhile mitigating representation collapse. The impact on coherence score\ndistributions suggests that the alignment mechanism strengthens semantic\nintegrity across diverse linguistic constructs, leading to a more balanced\norganization of learned embeddings. Computational assessments indicate that\nwhile the method introduces additional memory and training costs, the\nstructured optimization process justifies the trade-offs in applications\nrequiring heightened contextual fidelity.

In\nparticular, Spanish-speaking female participants who believed that they read an\nAI-generated advertisement strongly adjusted their donation behavior downwards.\nFurthermore, people are generally not able to adequately differentiate between\nhuman-generated and LLM-generated ads.

To\nthat end, we present results from an empirical exploration, where a human\nexpert-generated SE artifact was taken as a benchmark, parsed, and fed into\nvarious LLMs through prompt engineering to generate segments of typical SE\nartifacts. This procedure was applied without any fine-tuning or calibration to\ndocument baseline LLM performance.

BAV repair surgery is effective but challenging due to the\nheterogeneity of BAV morphology. Multiple imaging modalities can be employed to\nassist the quantitative assessment of BAVs for surgical planning.\nContrast-enhanced 4D computed tomography (CT) produces volumetric temporal\nsequences with excellent contrast and spatial resolution. Segmentation of the\naortic cusps and root in these images is an essential step in creating patient\nspecific models for visualization and quantification. While deep learning-based\nmethods are capable of fully automated segmentation, no BAV-specific model\nexists. Among valve segmentation studies, there has been limited quantitative\nassessment of the clinical usability of the segmentation results. In this work,\nwe developed a fully auto- mated multi-label BAV segmentation pipeline based on\nnnU-Net. The predicted segmentations were used to carry out surgically relevant\nmorphological measurements including geometric cusp height, commissural angle\nand annulus diameter, and the results were compared against manual\nsegmentation. Automated segmentation achieved average Dice scores of over 0.7\nand symmetric mean distance below 0.7 mm for all three aortic cusps and the\nroot wall. Clinically relevant benchmarks showed good consistency between\nmanual and predicted segmentations. Overall, fully automated BAV segmentation\nof 3D frames in 4D CT can produce clinically usable measurements for surgical\nrisk stratification, but the temporal consistency of segmentations needs to be\nimproved.\n","authors":["Zaiyang Guo","Ningjun J Dong","Harold Litt","Natalie Yushkevich","Melanie Freas","Jessica Nunez","Victor Ferrari","Jilei Hao","Shir Goldfinger","Matthew A.

Recent methods for memory mitigation have primarily\naddressed the issue within the context of the text modality in cross-modal\ngeneration tasks, restricting their applicability to specific conditions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method for diffusion models from the perspective\nof visual modality, which is more generic and fundamental for mitigating\nmemorization. Directly exposing visual data to the model increases memorization\nrisk, so we design a framework where models learn through proxy model\nparameters instead. Specially, the training dataset is divided into multiple\nshards, with each shard training a proxy model, then aggregated to form the\nfinal model. Additionally, practical analysis of training losses illustrates\nthat the losses for easily memorable images tend to be obviously lower. Thus,\nwe skip the samples with abnormally low loss values from the current mini-batch\nto avoid memorizing. However, balancing the need to skip memorization-prone\nsamples while maintaining sufficient training data for high-quality image\ngeneration presents a key challenge. Thus, we propose IET-AGC+, which\nredistributes highly memorizable samples between shards, to mitigate these\nsamples from over-skipping. Furthermore, we dynamically augment samples based\non their loss values to further reduce memorization. Extensive experiments and\nanalysis on four datasets show that our method successfully reduces memory\ncapacity while maintaining performance.

Although\nradiology is at the forefront of AI adoption, in practice, the potential of AI\nmodels is often overshadowed by severe failures to generalize: AI models can\nhave performance degradation of up to 20% when transitioning from controlled\ntest environments to clinical use by radiologists. This mismatch raises\nconcerns that radiologists will be misled by incorrect AI predictions in\npractice and/or grow to distrust AI, rendering these promising technologies\npractically ineffectual.

A common\napproach merges domain-specific sequences into cross-domain sequences, serving\nas bridges to connect domains. One key challenge is to correctly extract the\nshared knowledge among these sequences and appropriately transfer it. Most\nexisting works directly transfer unfiltered cross-domain knowledge rather than\nextracting domain-invariant components and adaptively integrating them into\ndomain-specific modelings. Another challenge lies in aligning the\ndomain-specific and cross-domain sequences. Existing methods align these\nsequences based on timestamps, but this approach can cause prediction\nmismatches when the current tokens and their targets belong to different\ndomains. In such cases, the domain-specific knowledge carried by the current\ntokens may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose the\nA-B-Cross-to-Invariant Learning Recommender (ABXI). Specifically, leveraging\nLoRA's effectiveness for efficient adaptation, ABXI incorporates two types of\nLoRAs to facilitate knowledge adaptation. First, all sequences are processed\nthrough a shared encoder that employs a domain LoRA for each sequence, thereby\npreserving unique domain characteristics. Next, we introduce an invariant\nprojector that extracts domain-invariant interests from cross-domain\nrepresentations, utilizing an invariant LoRA to adapt these interests into\nmodeling each specific domain. Besides, to avoid prediction mismatches, all\ndomain-specific sequences are aligned to match the domains of the cross-domain\nground truths.

Intents, as underlying factors of\ninteractions, are crucial for improving recommendation interpretability. Most\nmethods define intents as learnable parameters updated alongside interactions.\nHowever, existing frameworks often overlook textual information (e.g., user\nreviews, item descriptions), which is crucial for alleviating the sparsity of\ninteraction intents. Exploring these multimodal intents, especially the\ninherent differences in representation spaces, poses two key challenges: i) How\nto align multimodal intents and effectively mitigate noise issues; ii) How to\nextract and match latent key intents across modalities. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework, Intent Representation\nLearning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec), which leverages large language\nmodels (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents and enhance recommendations.\nSpecifically, IRLLRec employs a dual-tower architecture to learn multimodal\nintent representations. Next, we propose pairwise and translation alignment to\neliminate inter-modal differences and enhance robustness against noisy input\nfeatures. Finally, to better match textual and interaction-based intents, we\nemploy momentum distillation to perform teacher-student learning on fused\nintent representations.

This benchmark consists of 13,000 videos generated by\ntwo state-of-the-art open-source video generation models. We meticulously\ndesign a suite of rigorous metrics to accurately measure this preference,\naccounting for potential biases arising from the limited frame rate and\nsuboptimal quality of AIGC videos. We then applied three off-the-shelf video\nretrieval models to perform retrieval tasks on this hybrid dataset. Our\nfindings reveal a clear preference for AI-generated videos in retrieval.\nFurther investigation shows that incorporating AI-generated videos into the\ntraining set of retrieval models exacerbates this bias. Unlike the preference\nobserved in image modalities, we find that video retrieval bias arises from\nboth unseen visual and temporal information, making the root causes of video\nbias a complex interplay of these two factors. To mitigate this bias, we\nfine-tune the retrieval models using a contrastive learning approach. The\nresults of this study highlight the potential implications of AI-generated\nvideos on retrieval systems.\n","authors":["Haowen Gao","Liang Pang","Shicheng Xu","Leigang Qu","Tat-Seng Chua","Huawei Shen","Xueqi Cheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07327v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05558v2","updated":"2025-02-11T07:36:07Z","published":"2025-02-08T13:08:11Z","title":"Large Memory Network for Recommendation","summary":"  Modeling user behavior sequences in recommender systems is essential for\nunderstanding user preferences over time, enabling personalized and accurate\nrecommendations for improving user retention and enhancing business values.\nDespite its significance, there are two challenges for current sequential\nmodeling approaches.

Traditional offline evaluation methods for RS typically focus\non immediate user feedback, such as clicks, but they often neglect the\nlong-term impact of content creators. On real-world content platforms, creators\ncan strategically produce and upload new items based on user feedback and\npreference trends. While previous studies have attempted to model creator\nbehavior, they often overlook the role of information asymmetry. This asymmetry\narises because creators primarily have access to feedback on the items they\nproduce, while platforms possess data on the entire spectrum of user feedback.\nCurrent RS simulators, however, fail to account for this asymmetry, leading to\ninaccurate long-term evaluations. To address this gap, we propose CreAgent, a\nLarge Language Model (LLM)-empowered creator simulation agent. By incorporating\ngame theory's belief mechanism and the fast-and-slow thinking framework,\nCreAgent effectively simulates creator behavior under conditions of information\nasymmetry.

In this paper,\nwe observe that naively concatenating representations from semantic and\ncollaborative modality leads to a semantic domination issue, where the\nresulting representation is overly influenced by semantic information,\neffectively overshadowing the collaborative representation. Consequently,\ndownstream recommendation tasks fail to fully exploit the knowledge from both\nmodalities, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a\nprogressive collaborative and semantic knowledge fusion model for generative\nrecommendation, named PRORec, which integrates semantic and collaborative\nknowledge with a unified code through a two-stage framework. Specifically, in\nthe first stage, we propose a cross-modality knowledge alignment task, which\nintegrates semantic knowledge into collaborative embeddings, enhancing their\nrepresentational capability. In the second stage, we propose an in-modality\nknowledge distillation task, designed to effectively capture and integrate\nknowledge from both semantic and collaborative modalities. Extensive\nexperiments on three widely used benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our\napproach, demonstrating its superiority compared to existing methods.\n","authors":["Longtao Xiao","Haozhao Wang","Cheng Wang","Linfei Ji","Yifan Wang","Jieming Zhu","Zhenhua Dong","Rui Zhang","Ruixuan Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06269v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01457v2","updated":"2025-02-10T08:58:30Z","published":"2024-11-03T06:47:45Z","title":"Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential\n  Recommendation","summary":"  Sequential recommendation (SR) systems excel at capturing users' dynamic\npreferences by leveraging their interaction histories. Most existing SR systems\nassign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, and\nvarious types of models are adopted to combine these item embeddings into a\nsequence representation vector to capture the user intent. However, we argue\nthat this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's\nmulti-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Besides, users\noften exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking\nboth action and musical films in the facet of genre), which are challenging to\nfully represent. To address the issues above, we propose a novel structure\ncalled Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential\nRecommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the last\nmulti-head attention layer to predict the next item separately. This approach\ncaptures the potential multi-faceted nature of items without increasing model\ncomplexity. A gating mechanism integrates recommendations from each head and\ndynamically determines their importance. Furthermore, we introduce a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) network in each attention head to disentangle various\nuser preferences within each facet. Each expert within the MoE focuses on a\nspecific preference. A learnable router network is adopted to compute the\nimportance weight for each expert and aggregate them.

Since an information\ncascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection\nmodels leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information\npropagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the\nvariations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source\ninformation naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in\ndifferent heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the\ndata-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow\npropagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based\napproaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability\nto handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep\npropagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn\nobfuscate the predictions.

However, as\nthe scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer\nfrom accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational\nresources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue,\nwe observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a\nsequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable.\nThese subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their\ncurrent state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless\ntransitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of\nThoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists\nof decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic\ngraph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state.\nThis iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching\ndirectly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions\nbetween question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a\nplug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across\nsix benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a standalone\nframework and a plug-in enhancement.

The success of\ndeep learning models, and LLMs in particular, has been alternatively taken as\nshowing that the continuous camp has won, or dismissed as an irrelevant\nengineering development. However, in this position paper I argue that deep\nlearning models for language actually represent a synthesis between the two\ntraditions. This is because 1) deep learning architectures allow for both\ncontinuous/distributed and symbolic/discrete-like representations and\ncomputations; 2) models trained on language make use this flexibility. In\nparticular, I review recent research in mechanistic interpretability that\nshowcases how a substantial part of morphosyntactic knowledge is encoded in a\nnear-discrete fashion in LLMs. This line of research suggests that different\nbehaviors arise in an emergent fashion, and models flexibly alternate between\nthe two modes (and everything in between) as needed.

We then evaluate how well this small subset of generated\noutput fits the target model we are trying to train. We present a large-scale\nbenchmark covering diverse reasoning-based datasets to support our study.\n  The central idea is that a good output should closely resemble the output\ngenerated by the target LLM.

We connect this measurement to the perplexity metric used in\nprevious literature and demonstrate that leveraging an alignment-based metric\ncan provide better predictions of model performance.

However, the conventional KD methods endure\nthe distribution mismatch issue between the teacher and student models, leading\nto the poor performance of distillation. For instance, the widely-used KL-based\nmethods suffer the mode-averaging and mode-collapsing problems, since the\nmismatched probabitliy distribution between both models. Previous studies\nmainly optimize this issue via different distance calculations towards the\ndistribution of both models. Unfortunately, the distribution mismatch issue\nstill exists in the early stage of the distillation. Hence, to reduce the\nimpact of distribution mismatch, we propose a simple yet efficient method,\nnamed Warmup-Distill, which aligns the distillation of the student to that of\nthe teacher in advance of distillation. Specifically, we first detect the\ndistribution of the student model in practical scenarios with its internal\nknowledge, and then modify the knowledge with low probability via the teacher\nas the checker. Consequently, Warmup-Distill aligns the internal student's\nknowledge to that of the teacher, which expands the distribution of the student\nwith the teacher's, and assists the student model to learn better in the\nsubsequent distillation. Experiments on the seven benchmarks demonstrate that\nWarmup-Distill could provide a warmup student more suitable for distillation,\nwhich outperforms the vanilla student by as least +0.4 averaged score among all\nbenchmarks.

It consists of two key\nstructures: rhetorical structure and topic structure. The former captures the\nlogical flow of conversations, while the latter detects transitions between\ntopics. Together, they improve the ability of a dialogue system to track\nconversation dynamics and generate contextually relevant high-quality\nresponses. These structures are typically identified through discourse parsing\nand topic segmentation, respectively. However, existing supervised methods rely\non costly manual annotations, while unsupervised methods often focus on a\nsingle task, overlooking the deep linguistic interplay between rhetorical and\ntopic structures. To address these issues, we first introduce a unified\nrepresentation that integrates rhetorical and topic structures, ensuring\nsemantic consistency between them. Under the unified representation, we further\npropose two linguistically grounded hypotheses based on discourse theories: (1)\nLocal Discourse Coupling, where rhetorical cues dynamically enhance topic-aware\ninformation flow, and (2) Global Topology Constraint, where topic structure\npatterns probabilistically constrain rhetorical relation distributions.\nBuilding on the unified representation and two hypotheses, we propose an\nunsupervised mutual learning framework (UMLF) that jointly models rhetorical\nand topic structures, allowing them to mutually reinforce each other without\nrequiring additional annotations.

Utilizing large-scale public datasets\nfor training, our method delivers state-of-the-art performance in the tasks of\npose estimation, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis, while\nmaintaining the inference efficiency (i.e., less than 0.5 seconds).

Traditional approaches rely heavily\non manual annotation, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive.\nMoreover, the lack of large-scale benchmarks has hindered the development of\nlearning-based solutions. In this work, we present MagicArticulate, an\neffective framework that automatically transforms static 3D models into\narticulation-ready assets. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we\nintroduce Articulation-XL, a large-scale benchmark containing over 33k 3D\nmodels with high-quality articulation annotations, carefully curated from\nObjaverse-XL. Second, we propose a novel skeleton generation method that\nformulates the task as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging an\nauto-regressive transformer to naturally handle varying numbers of bones or\njoints within skeletons and their inherent dependencies across different 3D\nmodels. Third, we predict skinning weights using a functional diffusion process\nthat incorporates volumetric geodesic distance priors between vertices and\njoints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicArticulate significantly\noutperforms existing methods across diverse object categories, achieving\nhigh-quality articulation that enables realistic animation.

Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing\nnetworks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral\nstream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative\nhypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial\nlatents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are\nrepresentations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to\ncategorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets\ngenerated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We\nfound that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural\nalignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the\nspatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural\nalignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but\nnot identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle\nlayers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by\nnon-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the\nimplicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial\nlatents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream.\nThus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object\ncategorization only.

To bridge this gap, we propose Natural\nLip-to-Speech (NaturalL2S), an end-to-end framework integrating acoustic\ninductive biases with differentiable speech generation components.\nSpecifically, we introduce a fundamental frequency (F0) predictor to capture\nprosodic variations in synthesized speech.

This complexity also arises from the inherent\nlong-tail distribution of chords, where rare chord types are underrepresented\nin most datasets, leading to insufficient training samples. Effective chord\nrecognition requires leveraging contextual information from audio sequences,\nyet existing models, such as combinations of convolutional neural networks,\nbidirectional long short-term memory networks, and bidirectional transformers,\nface limitations in capturing long-term dependencies and exhibit suboptimal\nperformance on large-vocabulary chord recognition tasks.

While humans can\neffortlessly generalize a demonstrated tool manipulation skill to diverse tools\nthat support the same function (e.g., pouring with a mug versus a teapot),\ncurrent one-shot imitation learning (OSIL) methods struggle to achieve this. A\nkey challenge lies in establishing functional correspondences between\ndemonstration and test tools, considering significant geometric variations\namong tools with the same function (i.e., intra-function variations).

Unlike\npre-training, where MLLMs receive rich visual-text alignment,\ninstruction-tuning is often text-driven with weaker visual supervision, leading\nto the degradation of pre-trained visual understanding and causing visual\nforgetting. Existing approaches, such as direct fine-tuning and continual\nlearning methods, fail to explicitly address this issue, often compressing\nvisual representations and prioritizing task alignment over visual retention,\nwhich further worsens visual forgetting. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a novel perspective leveraging effective rank to quantify the\ndegradation of visual representation richness, interpreting this degradation\nthrough the information bottleneck principle as excessive compression that\nleads to the degradation of crucial pre-trained visual knowledge. Building on\nthis view, we propose a modality-decoupled gradient descent (MDGD) method that\nregulates gradient updates to maintain the effective rank of visual\nrepresentations while mitigating the over-compression effects described by the\ninformation bottleneck. By explicitly disentangling the optimization of visual\nunderstanding from task-specific alignment, MDGD preserves pre-trained visual\nknowledge while enabling efficient task adaptation. To enable lightweight\ninstruction-tuning, we further develop a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach\nusing gradient masking, which selectively updates a subset of model parameters\nto enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reducing computational\noverhead while preserving rich visual representations.

These approaches have the advantages of being easily\nadaptable to a particular problem and they fit very efficiently when data is\navailable. However, mainly due to the excess of parameters, they have the\nproblems of lack of interpretability, and over-fitting.

We further devise a three-stage training pipeline to\nconjoin the low-complexity attention and few-step generation capacities.\nNotably, with 0.1% pretraining data, we turn the Open-Sora-Plan-1.2 model into\nan efficient one that is 7.4x -7.8x faster for 29 and 93 frames 720p video\ngeneration with a marginal performance trade-off in VBench.

In this work, we\ninvestigate whether slot representations extracted from visual scenes serve as\nappropriate compositional abstractions for grounding and reasoning. We present\nthe Neural Slot Interpreter (NSI), which learns to ground object semantics in\nslots. At the core of NSI is an XML-like schema that uses simple syntax rules\nto organize the object semantics of a scene into object-centric schema\nprimitives. Then, the NSI metric learns to ground primitives into slots through\na structured contrastive learning objective that reasons over the intermodal\nalignment. Experiments with a bi-modal object-property and scene retrieval task\ndemonstrate the grounding efficacy and interpretability of correspondences\nlearned by NSI.

In this work,\nwe introduce a novel concept-hiding approach that makes unwanted concepts\ninaccessible to public users while allowing controlled recovery when needed.\nInstead of erasing knowledge from the model entirely, we incorporate a\nlearnable prompt into the cross-attention module, acting as a secure memory\nthat suppresses the generation of hidden concepts unless a secret key is\nprovided. This enables flexible access control -- ensuring that undesirable\ncontent cannot be easily generated while preserving the option to reinstate it\nunder restricted conditions. Our method introduces a new paradigm where concept\nsuppression and controlled recovery coexist, which was not feasible in prior\nworks.

Unlike nominal\nclassification, which treats all classes as equally distinct, OC takes the\nordinal relationship into account, producing more accurate and relevant\nresults. This is particularly critical in applications where the magnitude of\nclassification errors has implications. Despite this, OC problems are often\ntackled using nominal methods, leading to suboptimal solutions. Although\ndecision trees are one of the most popular classification approaches, ordinal\ntree-based approaches have received less attention when compared to other\nclassifiers. This work conducts an experimental study of tree-based\nmethodologies specifically designed to capture ordinal relationships. A\ncomprehensive survey of ordinal splitting criteria is provided, standardising\nthe notations used in the literature for clarity. Three ordinal splitting\ncriteria, Ordinal Gini (OGini), Weighted Information Gain (WIG), and Ranking\nImpurity (RI), are compared to the nominal counterparts of the first two (Gini\nand information gain), by incorporating them into a decision tree classifier.\nAn extensive repository considering 45 publicly available OC datasets is\npresented, supporting the first experimental comparison of ordinal and nominal\nsplitting criteria using well-known OC evaluation metrics. Statistical analysis\nof the results highlights OGini as the most effective ordinal splitting\ncriterion to date.

To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets\ngenerated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We\nfound that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural\nalignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the\nspatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural\nalignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but\nnot identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle\nlayers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by\nnon-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the\nimplicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken\ntogether, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial\nlatents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream.\nThus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object\ncategorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of\ncomparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the\nventral stream.\n","authors":["Yudi Xie","Weichen Huang","Esther Alter","Jeremy Schwartz","Joshua B.

However, as\nthe scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer\nfrom accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational\nresources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue,\nwe observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a\nsequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable.\nThese subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their\ncurrent state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless\ntransitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of\nThoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists\nof decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic\ngraph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state.\nThis iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching\ndirectly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions\nbetween question states.

Nonetheless, these methods often encounter difficulties when\ndealing with real-world graphs, particularly in the presence of noisy edges.\nAdditionally, many denoising graph clustering methods tend to suffer from lower\nperformance, training instability, and challenges in scaling to large datasets\ncompared to non-denoised models. To tackle these issues, we introduce a new\nframework called the Robust Deep Graph Clustering Framework via Dual Soft\nAssignment (RDSA). RDSA consists of three key components: (i) a node embedding\nmodule that effectively integrates the graph's topological features and node\nattributes; (ii) a structure-based soft assignment module that improves graph\nmodularity by utilizing an affinity matrix for node assignments; and (iii) a\nnode-based soft assignment module that identifies community landmarks and\nrefines node assignments to enhance the model's robustness. We assess RDSA on\nvarious real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance relative to\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. Our findings indicate that RDSA provides\nrobust clustering across different graph types, excelling in clustering\neffectiveness and robustness, including adaptability to noise, stability, and\nscalability.\n","authors":["Yang Xiang","Li Fan","Tulika Saha","Xiaoying Pang","Yushan Pan","Haiyang Zhang","Chengtao Ji"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21745v4.pdf","comment":"Accepted by DASFAA 2025; Complete version"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11986v1","updated":"2025-02-17T16:26:05Z","published":"2025-02-17T16:26:05Z","title":"Selective Task Group Updates for Multi-Task Optimization","summary":"  Multi-task learning enables the acquisition of task-generic knowledge by\ntraining multiple tasks within a unified architecture.

However, their\noptimization strategy focuses on addressing task imbalance in shared\nparameters, neglecting the learning of task-specific parameters. As a result,\nthey show limitations in mitigating negative transfer, since the learning of\nshared space and task-specific information influences each other during\noptimization. To address this, we propose a different approach to enhance\nmulti-task performance by selectively grouping tasks and updating them for each\nbatch during optimization.

This work proposes\nChordFormer, a novel conformer-based architecture designed to tackle structural\nchord recognition (e.g., triads, bass, sevenths) for large vocabularies.\nChordFormer leverages conformer blocks that integrate convolutional neural\nnetworks with transformers, thus enabling the model to capture both local\npatterns and global dependencies effectively. By addressing challenges such as\nclass imbalance through a reweighted loss function and structured chord\nrepresentations, ChordFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a\n2% improvement in frame-wise accuracy and a 6% increase in class-wise accuracy\non large-vocabulary chord datasets. Furthermore, ChordFormer excels in handling\nclass imbalance, providing robust and balanced recognition across chord types.\nThis approach bridges the gap between theoretical music knowledge and practical\napplications, advancing the field of large-vocabulary chord recognition.\n","authors":["Muhammad Waseem Akram","Stefano Dettori","Valentina Colla","Giorgio Carlo Buttazzo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11840v1.pdf","comment":"13 pages, 4 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11836v1","updated":"2025-02-17T14:31:00Z","published":"2025-02-17T14:31:00Z","title":"Model Generalization on Text Attribute Graphs: Principles with Large\n  Language Models","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) have recently been introduced to graph learning,\naiming to extend their zero-shot generalization success to tasks where labeled\ngraph data is scarce.

To address this, we propose LD3, a\nlightweight framework designed to learn the optimal time discretization for\nsampling. LD3 can be combined with various samplers and consistently improves\ngeneration quality without having to retrain resource-intensive neural\nnetworks. We demonstrate analytically and empirically that LD3 improves\nsampling efficiency with much less computational overhead. We evaluate our\nmethod with extensive experiments on 7 pre-trained models, covering\nunconditional and conditional sampling in both pixel-space and latent-space\nDPMs. We achieve FIDs of 2.38 (10 NFE), and 2.27 (10 NFE) on unconditional\nCIFAR10 and AFHQv2 in 5-10 minutes of training. LD3 offers an efficient\napproach to sampling from pre-trained diffusion models.

Unlike\npre-training, where MLLMs receive rich visual-text alignment,\ninstruction-tuning is often text-driven with weaker visual supervision, leading\nto the degradation of pre-trained visual understanding and causing visual\nforgetting. Existing approaches, such as direct fine-tuning and continual\nlearning methods, fail to explicitly address this issue, often compressing\nvisual representations and prioritizing task alignment over visual retention,\nwhich further worsens visual forgetting. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a novel perspective leveraging effective rank to quantify the\ndegradation of visual representation richness, interpreting this degradation\nthrough the information bottleneck principle as excessive compression that\nleads to the degradation of crucial pre-trained visual knowledge. Building on\nthis view, we propose a modality-decoupled gradient descent (MDGD) method that\nregulates gradient updates to maintain the effective rank of visual\nrepresentations while mitigating the over-compression effects described by the\ninformation bottleneck. By explicitly disentangling the optimization of visual\nunderstanding from task-specific alignment, MDGD preserves pre-trained visual\nknowledge while enabling efficient task adaptation.

A unified scene specification is generated directly from\nsimulators or real-world sensors and transmitted to XR headsets, creating\nidentical scenes in XR. This specification allows IRIS to support any of the\nobjects, assets, and robots provided by the simulators. In addition, IRIS\nintroduces shared spatial anchors and a robust communication protocol that\nlinks simulations between multiple XR headsets. This feature enables multiple\nXR headsets to share a synchronized scene, facilitating collaborative and\nmulti-user data collection. IRIS can be deployed on any device that supports\nthe Unity Framework, encompassing the vast majority of commercially available\nheadsets. In this work, IRIS was deployed and tested on the Meta Quest 3 and\nthe HoloLens 2. IRIS showcased its versatility across a wide range of\nreal-world and simulated scenarios, using current popular robot simulators such\nas MuJoCo, IsaacSim, CoppeliaSim, and Genesis. In addition, a user study\nevaluates IRIS on a data collection task for the LIBERO benchmark. The study\nshows that IRIS significantly outperforms the baseline in both objective and\nsubjective metrics.\n","authors":["Xinkai Jiang","Qihao Yuan","Enes Ulas Dincer","Hongyi Zhou","Ge Li","Xueyin Li","Julius Haag","Nicolas Schreiber","Kailai Li","Gerhard Neumann","Rudolf Lioutikov"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03297v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11687v1","updated":"2025-02-17T11:25:28Z","published":"2025-02-17T11:25:28Z","title":"ReVeil: Unconstrained Concealed Backdoor Attack on Deep Neural Networks\n  using Machine Unlearning","summary":"  Backdoor attacks embed hidden functionalities in deep neural networks (DNN),\ntriggering malicious behavior with specific inputs.

While recent advancements adopt\nlarge language models (LLMs) for realistic tabular data generation, their long\ntraining times and limited reusability hinder practical applications. In this\npaper, we propose Tabula, a tabular data synthesizer that leverages the\nstructure of LLM. Unlike state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM-based tabular data\nsynthesizers that rely on pre-trained LLMs, Tabula discards the pre-trained\nweights originally designed for natural language tasks, focusing instead on a\ntailored approach for tabular data. In addition, Tabula introduces a token\nsequence compression strategy that significantly reduces training time while\nmaintaining data quality, alongside a novel token padding method that improves\nsequence alignment across training batches. Experiments on six datasets show\nthat Tabula achieves superior synthetic data utility compared to current SOTA\nmethods. Additionally, the results demonstrate that Tabula model trained on\ntabular datasets serves effectively as a foundational model for synthesizing\nnew tabular datasets. Furthermore, the proposed padding method outperforms the\nconventional left and right padding strategies.

To address this, various memory-efficient\noptimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage.

However, the current ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) solver for FDMs, e.g., the Euler solver, still\nsuffers from slow generation since ODE solvers need many number function\nevaluations (NFE) to keep high-quality generation. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel training-free flow-solver to reduce NFE while maintaining high-quality\ngeneration. The key insight for the flow-solver is to leverage the previous\nsteps to reduce the NFE, where a cache is created to reuse these results from\nthe previous steps. Specifically, the Taylor expansion is first used to\napproximate the ODE. To calculate the high-order derivatives of Taylor\nexpansion, the flow-solver proposes to use the previous steps and a polynomial\ninterpolation to approximate it, where the number of orders we could\napproximate equals the number of previous steps we cached.

Addressing this, we introduce a novel\nTarget-Aware Transformer for STVG (TA-STVG), which seeks to adaptively generate\nobject queries via exploring target-specific cues from the given video-text\npair, for improving STVG.

In this work, we shed light on an issue in the existing pair-wise\nlearning paradigm (i.e., the embedding collapse problem), that the\nrepresentations tend to span a subspace of the whole embedding space, leading\nto a suboptimal solution and reducing the model capacity. Specifically,\noptimization on observed interactions is equivalent to a low pass filter\ncausing users/items to have the same representations and resulting in a\ncomplete collapse. While negative sampling acts as a high pass filter to\nalleviate the collapse by balancing the embedding spectrum, its effectiveness\nis only limited to certain losses, which still leads to an incomplete collapse.\nTo tackle this issue, we propose a novel method called DirectSpec, acting as a\nreliable all pass filter to balance the spectrum distribution of the embeddings\nduring training, ensuring that users/items effectively span the entire\nembedding space. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of DirectSpec\nfrom a decorrelation perspective and propose an enhanced variant, DirectSpec+,\nwhich employs self-paced gradients to optimize irrelevant samples more\neffectively. Moreover, we establish a close connection between DirectSpec+ and\nuniformity, demonstrating that contrastive learning (CL) can alleviate the\ncollapse issue by indirectly balancing the spectrum.

To capture this set-theoretic dependence we\nrepresent each user and attribute by a hyper-rectangle or box (i.e. a Cartesian\nproduct of intervals). Box embeddings can intuitively be understood as\ntrainable Venn diagrams, and thus not only inherently represent similarity (via\nthe Jaccard index), but also naturally and faithfully support arbitrary\nset-theoretic relationships.

It involves assigning item identifiers for LLMs to encode user history\nand generate the next item. Existing approaches leverage either token-sequence\nidentifiers, representing items as discrete token sequences, or single-token\nidentifiers, using ID or semantic embeddings. Token-sequence identifiers face\nissues such as the local optima problem in beam search and low generation\nefficiency due to step-by-step generation. In contrast, single-token\nidentifiers fail to capture rich semantics or encode Collaborative Filtering\n(CF) information, resulting in suboptimal performance.\n  To address these issues, we propose two fundamental principles for item\nidentifier design: 1) integrating both CF and semantic information to fully\ncapture multi-dimensional item information, and 2) designing order-agnostic\nidentifiers without token dependency, mitigating the local optima issue and\nachieving simultaneous generation for generation efficiency. Accordingly, we\nintroduce a novel set identifier paradigm for LLM-based generative\nrecommendation, representing each item as a set of order-agnostic tokens. To\nimplement this paradigm, we propose SETRec, which leverages CF and semantic\ntokenizers to obtain order-agnostic multi-dimensional tokens.

CluSD takes a lightweight\ncluster-based approach and exploits the overlap of sparse retrieval results and\nembedding clusters in a two-stage selection process with an LSTM model to\nquickly identify relevant clusters while incurring limited extra memory space\noverhead. CluSD triggers partial dense retrieval and performs cluster-based\nblock disk I/O if needed. This paper evaluates CluSD and compares it with\nseveral baselines for searching in-memory and on-disk MS MARCO and BEIR\ndatasets.\n","authors":["Yingrui Yang","Parker Carlson","Yifan Qiao","Wentai Xie","Shanxiu He","Tao Yang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10639v1.pdf","comment":"This paper is accepted by ECIR'25"}],"Multimedia":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10663v1","updated":"2025-02-15T04:00:43Z","published":"2025-02-15T04:00:43Z","title":"REAL: Realism Evaluation of Text-to-Image Generation Models for\n  Effective Data Augmentation","summary":"  Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation models have transformed\nthe field. However, challenges persist in generating images that reflect\ndemanding textual descriptions, especially for fine-grained details and unusual\nrelationships. Existing evaluation metrics focus on text-image alignment but\noverlook the realism of the generated image, which can be crucial for\ndownstream applications like data augmentation in machine learning. To address\nthis gap, we propose REAL, an automatic evaluation framework that assesses\nrealism of T2I outputs along three dimensions: fine-grained visual attributes,\nunusual visual relationships, and visual styles. REAL achieves a Spearman's rho\nscore of up to 0.62 in alignment with human judgement and demonstrates utility\nin ranking and filtering augmented data for tasks like im- age captioning,\nclassification, and visual relationship detection. Empirical results show that\nhigh-scoring images evaluated by our metrics improve F1 scores of image\nclassification by up to 11.3%, while low-scoring ones degrade that by up to\n4.95%. We benchmark four major T2I models across the realism dimensions,\nproviding insights for future improvements in T2I output realism.\n","authors":["Ran Li","Xiaomeng Jin","Heng ji"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10663v1.pdf","comment":null}]}}
